  reworked macro resolution
* moved test_macro_name_with_colon() to class TestXacro
  should be tested both, in oldorder and inorder mode
* bash completion
* improved error message for failed $(find)
* reworked macro resolution
  python-eval-based macro resolution (introduced to enable namespaces)
  heavily restricted the set of possible macro names (only valid python
  identifiers were allowed)
  Particularly, xacro: prefixed macro names were forbidden.
* initial attempt to fix #97
* add failing test case with colon in the macro name
* Contributors: Robert Haschke

-------------------
* removed test_DEPRECATED_should_replace_before_macroexpand()
  duplicates test_should_replace_before_macroexpand()
* fixed evaluation order of macro arguments and body
  Macro arguments need to be evaluated and assigned to properties before
  body is evaluated. Otherwise, the evaluated value will be converted to
  str, i.e. loosing original type.
* Contributors: Robert Haschke

1.10.3 (2015-06-16)
-------------------
* deprecate --oldorder processing
* added --check-order option to do a simple check for --inorder compatibility
  - Most probable incompatibility is redefining a property after its usage.
  - tested and reported with file location of (first) redefinition after usage.
* moved command line processing to cli.py
* explain verbosity levels in usage string
* colorize errors during cli parsing
* log definition and usage of properties
* replaced debug option by verbosity options -q, -v

* added option --oldorder
* allow to store properties to parent or global scope
* added <xacro:attribute>
* cleaned up error message about missing files
* moved xml-specific functions to xmlutils.py
  new generic functions opt_attrs(), reqd_attrs(), and check_attrs()
  to fetch optional and required attributes and warn about unknown ones
  in a uniform fashion
* unittest to allow empty <arg> defaults
* Merge pull request #94 from ubi-agni/minor-fixes
* minor fixes
* remove duplicates in --deps output
* fixed dependency checking for --inorder mode (which requires full processing)
* fixed doc of xacro' cmake macros
* renamed "xacro:rename" to "xacro:element"
* allow namespacing for xacro:include's
* allow renaming of element names using xacro:rename
* unittest cleanup
* check property and macro names to be valid python identifiers
* allow namespacing of xacro:include's
* properties and macros in an included file will go into their own,
  separate namespace, if the XML attribute `ns` is provided.
  Access is by standard python syntax: namespace.name
* allow renaming of element names
  <xacro:rename xacro:name="<new element name>"/>
* moved unittests requiring --inorder processing to class TestXacroInorder
* added unittest test_dynamic_macro_undefined()
* improved error message when variable include filename is used 
  without --inorder
* stripped down unittest test_inorder_processing()
* improved processing
* adapted pr2 gold standard removing most comments again
  this partially reverts 59605fb1521583dc63efdea13f4c45128499bd20
* remove all XML comments directly before xacro elements
  (These are considered xacro-related only and should be removed in the final doc.)
  Leaving an empty line between xacro-unrelated and xacro-related comments
  allows to include the former.
* unittest: test_ignore_xacro_comments()
* improved processing
  - recursive (instead of iterative) eval_all()
  - reusable process_include()
  - replace_node() function to replace xacro tag by some other content
  - avoid reprocessing of nodes
  - avoid deep copy where possible (speedup)
* fix evaluation (#83)
* yaml support
* check for consistency of xml namespaces on xacro:include
* replaced strip()=='' by more efficient isspace()
* allow transitive definition of substition args
* fixed evaluation of literals in property definitions
  - literals with preceding whitespace will be silently stripped (#83)
  - more complex evaluation test (perturbing spaces added)
* fixed xacro namespaces in pr2 files to get rid of new inconsistency warning
* warning message on inconsistent namespace redefinition for includes
* yaml support
  ${load_yaml('file.yaml')} to load dict from yaml file
* Merge pull request #85 from ubi-agni/error-reporting
  improved error reporting
* nicer formatting of multiple "when evaluating expression" lines
* improved formatting of error messages
  use XacroException to wrap and augment other exceptions
  to achieve a clearer error formatting
* better error message for missing substitution args
* use colorized warnings where possible
* included macro stack in error-reporting
* maintain filestack to facilitate error reporting at any time
* Merge pull request #82 from ubi-agni/unittests
  improved unittesting
* allow to capture (and check) stderr in unit tests
* improved unittests to test both, classic and in-order processing
* Merge pull request #81 from ubi-agni/jade-devel
  Thank you for your time and contributions. Improving cosmetics is important.
* PEP8 cleanup
* cmake: only copy files to devel space if new
* Merge pull request #80 from ubi-agni/jade-devel
* improved error-handling opening the output file
  - running multiple xacro process in parallel, all writing into a new dir
  could cause a race condition when creating the dir
  - improved error message on output creation failure
* removed rospy dependency
  - Importing rospy caused build order issues with ros_comm in workspace
* Filtering out REMAP command-line arguments is done manually now.
* update authors/maintainers and copyright statements
* deprecate non-namespaced xacro tags
* added missing print_location_msg() for file that actually failed parsing
* improved deprecation warnings
* New cli option `--xacro-ns` allows to enforce the new policy
  requiring the xacro namespace prefix (and suppressing deprecation warnings).
  However, non-prefixed tags will not be modified by xacro anymore
  (as requested by #41, #59, #60).
  Partially reverted cb73cfd8c678adfda2172accef398189ea2338a1, handling
  <arg> tags in the same fashion as other tags, i.e. issue a warning if
  used without prefix and ignoring it with cli argument `--xacro-ns`.
* fixed pr2 xacro files to use 'xacro:' prefixed tags only
* fixed unittests in test_xacro.py to use 'xacro:' prefixed tags only
* deprecation message for missing xacro namespace prefix in xml tags
* moved colored warning messages into color.py (for reuseability)
* added missing print_location_msg() for file that actually failed parsing
* improved xacro's cmake macros
* prepend ${PACKAGE_NAME} to all generated cmake targets
  Otherwise multiple packages employing xacro's cmake macros will use the
  same conflicting target name.
  This is only an issue with catkin_make, which defines a single global
  cmake namespace. The new catkin tools (or catkin_make_isolated) build
  each package separately.
* basic unittest for xacro's cmake macros
* improved xacro's cmake macros
  - xacro_add_xacro_file() automatically determines output file from input (removing .xacro suffix).
  If that fails, a fatal error is raised.
  - added xacro_install() to allow installation into both, devel and install space.
  - replaced conveniency function xacro_add_files()
* Contributors: Robert Haschke

1.10.2 (2015-05-23)
-------------------

* added --debug option to explicitly enable stack traces
  By default, only show error message to the user.
  Stack traces are only interesting for xacro developers.
* recursive include processing
  - more informed error messages (which file was included from where)
  - allows relative path names for include filename specs
  they are interpreted relative to the current file
* new substitution command $(cwd) to extract current working directory
* added unittest cases
  - creation of required subdirs for output
  - recursive xacro:include
  - extended test_include_glob() to check for all glob patterns
* added run_xacro() function to simplify unittests running xacro script
* moved xacro.py back to original location
* nicely colored deprecation warning
* create required dirs before opening output file
* added convenience cmake-macro xacro_add_target()
  to auto-generate xacro-processed files
* added cmake status message before launching xacro
  (xacro might run for quite a while)
* fetch xacro --deps errors at report them as a warning
* simplified deprecation message
* added missing return statement
* removed obsolete math import
  left over from deaaae2c69edd7d5e185eeb098c1521d8711608b
* install xacro.py again (for backwards compatibility)
  usage of xacro.py issues a deprecation warning
* simplified scripts/xacro - removed xacro.py
  - made run script "scripts/xacro" and install process follow standards
  - removed xacro.py
  - added dependencies to setup.py
  Having the binaries xacro and xacro.py installed side by side causes
  problems, because xacro.py is wrongly taken as the module.
  This was avoided by the rather complex filtering of the sys.path.
  Switched to ROS standard now, using a binary script called "xacro".
* changed tests to use the whole xacro processing pipeline
  utilizing the modularization of main() from previous commit
  This simplifies several existing tests, especially these using files on disk.
* split main() into process_cli_arg(), parse(), process_doc()
* extended cmake macro xacro_add_xacro_file()
  - handle INORDER option
  - handle REMAP arguments
  - create absolute input file names automatically
  usage: xacro_add_xacro_file(input output INORDER REMAP ...)
* stripped new unit tests to essential xml snippets
* merged pull request `#68 <https://github.com/ros/xacro/issues/68>`_: eval properties assigned from <arg> tags as literals
  In the following example:
  <xacro:arg name="val" default="0.5"/>
  <xacro:property name="val" value="$(arg val)"/>
  ${val} was not evaluated as a number, but as string only.
  Thus numerical expressions failed with an exception.
* factored out get_boolean_value()
* <xacro:arg> needs to be fully specified
* (handling <arg> tags (without xacro ns-prefix) disabled native <arg> tags)
  add test for eating launch parameter arguments
  remove check for "arg" parameter.
  move new test function to bottom of source
* added unit tests for evaluation of list, tuple, and dict literals
* fixed some code style issues
* fixed string-isinstance checks (for python 3 compatibility)
* do not evaluate list, dict, tuple expressions as literals (without ${} syntax)
* added dict to list of known global symbols
* focused global_symbols definition in the beginning of the file
  added some basic python symbols: list, str, float, int and map
  allowing some basic computation
* tuning performance: instantiate QuickLexer's regexps only once
* Contributors: Robert Haschke, Martin Pecka, Mike O'Driscoll, Morgan Quigley

1.10.1 (2015-04-01)
-------------------
* improved error handling and more descriptive error messages
* correctly raise a XacroException on invalid, i.e. non-boolean, <xacro:if> expressions.
  (removed left-over debugging code, added test case)
* raise an exception on undefined, but used macros
  Using the syntax <xacro:macroname/> should raise an exception if
  macroname is not defined. Added appropriate code and a test case.
* fixed bookkeeping in lazy evaluation
  switch Table.unevaluated from list to set to avoid multiple key entries
* fix formatting of changelog
* Contributors: Robert Haschke

1.10.0 (2015-03-13)
-------------------
* security measure: forbid access to __builtins__ in expressions
* literal evaluation should only consider literals, but no expressions use ast.literal_eval()
* removed eval() from xacro:if evaluation
* back to string comparison to handle (lowercase) true and false
* add test case for equality expressions in <xacro:if>
* add test case for math function usage
* python based evaluation of expressions
  - replaced handle_expr with python-internal eval() call
  - care has been taken to resolve variables recursively on demand (in Table.__getitem__)
  - allows for evaluation of standard math functions
  - other desired functions could be added in eval_self_contained
  - Values in Table symbols are not stored as strings but as typed values.
* If text is required, a conversion with str() is performed, to ensure 
  proper evaluation of expressions. Otherwise 3*"1" would evaluate to "111".
* use __future__.division we can handle integer division evaluating to 
  floating-point devision, as before
* allow variable names for filename attribute in <xacro:include>
* allow for ordered XML processing to avoid issues with multiply defined
  properties and macros in (typically 3rd party) include files
  - enable the new behaviour by passing --inorder cmdline option
  - to improve code readibility and reusability, introduced functions
* process_include(node), grab_macro(elt, macros), grab_property(elt, symbols)
  containing 1:1 corresponding handling from process_includes, grab_macros, 
  and grab_properties
  - added corresponding test case test_inorder_processing()
* dynamic macro names using <xacro:call macro=""/>
* fixup unittests and handling of non-element nodes in <include>, <if>, <macro>
* updated pr2 gold standard to include all comments
* allow to ignore comments in nodes_match()
* New handling of non-element nodes invalidates pr2 gold standard (adding
  a lot more comments). To allow validation, allow to ignore all
  comments in comparison (as before).
* fixed handling of non-element nodes in <include>, <if>, <macro>
* fixed writexml: text nodes were not printed when other siblings exist
  - print all text, but skip whitespace-only text nodes
* improved xml matching
  - so far only element nodes (with its attributes) were considered
  - now also consider TEXT, CDATA, and COMMENT nodes
  - added function text_matches (normalizing consecutive whitespace to a single space)
  - added some new unit tests
  - test_consider_non_elements:
  non-element nodes are not yet considered in <if> and <macro>
* travis-ci: use catkin_make
* travis-ci: fixup running of tests
* fix pathnames used in test case
* Include CATKIN_ENV params at build time.
* use output filename flag instead of shell redirection
* create output file after parsing is complete, not before
